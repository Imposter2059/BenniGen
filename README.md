So, discord nitro miners... You all want nitro, but you are broke. ._. There is a simple solution, discord nitro miners. How this works is it will render a check, checking a nitro code. There is a tiny chance for it being valid, but you can render multiple checks. If you are lucky you will get a valid code. The simple way so that it isn't relying on luck, is to have a beefy PC so you can render many, more checks, therefore increasing the chances of finding a valid nitro code. So there you have it! :D
!!This project is COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE!! Have fun =)

# License
Certainly! The GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0) is a widely recognized open-source software license. If you're using or encountering software licensed under GPL-3.0, here's what you need to know:

Freedom to Use, Modify, and Share
The GPL-3.0 grants you the freedom to use, modify, and share the software. This means you can use the software for any purpose, adapt it to suit your needs, and distribute it to others.

Copyleft Principle
One of the unique aspects of GPL-3.0 is its copyleft provision. It ensures that any modifications or derivatives of the software must also be licensed under GPL-3.0. This means that if you modify a GPL-3.0 licensed software, you must share your modifications under the same license terms.

Access to Source Code
The GPL-3.0 ensures that users have access to the source code of the software. This allows users to understand how the software works, make modifications, and contribute back to the community.

Patent Grant
The GPL-3.0 includes a patent provision that prevents contributors from asserting patent claims against users of the software. This ensures that users can use the software without worrying about patent issues from the contributors.

Compatibility
The GPL-3.0 is compatible with many other open-source licenses, but it may not be compatible with proprietary licenses that impose additional restrictions. It's important to understand the compatibility of GPL-3.0 with other licenses if you plan to combine or distribute software under different licenses.

No Warranty
Like many open-source licenses, the GPL-3.0 comes with no warranties. This means that the software is provided as-is, without any guarantees regarding its fitness for any particular purpose. Users and contributors use the software at their own risk.

Notice and Attribution
If you distribute software under the GPL-3.0, you must include a copy of the GPL-3.0 license text with the distributed software, along with any applicable copyright notices.

In summary, the GPL-3.0 promotes the principles of open-source software by ensuring that users have the freedom to use, modify, and share software while also ensuring that these freedoms are preserved for future users and contributors. It's important to understand the terms of the GPL-3.0 license when using or distributing software licensed under it.
